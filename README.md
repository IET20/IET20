# IET20
For Final year Batch of 2020  Farewell or not so farewell Let's see what will happen, but before that think. How we all final year_ies used to imagine ki bas placement season khatam ho or apni masti ki baatein hogi, hotho pr un 7 semester me kiye huye kand or aankon me un hazaro lamho ki yadein hogi Sath me puri puri rat ghumne ke plans bhi bnaye honge ya phir se ek bar sbke sath Jaam gate ka sunrise dekhne ke sapne sajaye honge Hostel ki un deewaro ke beechh chhupi vo shararate uchal kr vapis aane ko krti hogi Yaaro ke sath beth kr beeti vo dhalti shamein phir hakikat me aane ko kehti hogi Canteen ke us  ek samose ko , na jaane kbse un yaaro ki gang ka intezaar hoga vo backstage ka khali maidan phir un cricketers ko pukarta hoga..   Well quarantine washed it all away, but could it ruin our farewell and feeling for each other? No.  Why don't we get back to our gallery and select your best photo and then write up the best of your memories or any other sentiments you want to express before leaving this beautiful tag , "College Student." There is no language barrier it can be any Hindi, English or mix of both, just pure feelings. So that we could collect them all for you, and would send a softcopy of yearbook to your class groups.  Here's a gift from us to you, your  yearbook. "IMPRESSIONS " - Class of 2020
